My favorite haunt is the the [Egee.io Discord server](https://discord.gg/EMbcgR8) Discord server which is also the nexus for the [Egee.io](https://egee.io) community!

It is less of a server _for me_ and more of a server for my viewers, fans, and friends.

Everyone is welcome to join as long as they follow these rules:

* Discord [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and [guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) apply here. (TL;DR: no illegal stuff, doxxing, or users under the age of 13.)
* No hate speech, bigotry, or deliberate trolling.
* Keep conversation topics in their respective channels.
* Keep discussions & posts reasonably appropriate for all age groups; No NSFW/NSFL.

_The original Operating System & Linux Distro review series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J)!_

Despite the name, the series intends to cover *all* Operating Systems. Or, as the Linux community likes to call them, **Distributions**!

### What's the point?
Because operating systems are fun! *(seriously)*

Each episode looks at a different operating system and quickly examines the basics from an average user's perspective.

A regular episode usually has these segments:

- Install
- Desktop & Apps
- Network & Sharing
- Devices + Media
- Gaming (legacy)
- Summary

Episodes are written to be informative *and* entertaining!

### Hardware
Most episodes are recorded on physical hardware!

The "Distro Delves PC" changes based on the season and what the *theme* is:

| Season      | CPU | GPU | RAM | SSD| Theme |
| ----------- |
| One   | A8-7600 | 750ti | 16GB | Samsung 830 | Spare Parts|
| Two   | A8-7600 | 750ti or r370 | 8GB | ADATA SP550 | 2015-era |

### Production Software
All episodes are produced with Linux & Open Software! The only exception is my [HD60](https://amzn.to/335LjSs), which only has driver support for macOS & Windows.

Episode scripts are written in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and checked with [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

Voice-over audio is recorded and edited using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). I use Noise-Gate and Compressor plugins. My microphone is a [SM57](https://amzn.to/3m4x4Gq).

Episodes are produced and rendered using [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) [18.12](https://files.kde.org/kdenlive/release/), the last truly stable version of Kdenlive.

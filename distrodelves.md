The Operating System & Linux Distro non-review web series on YouTube examining different Operating Systems just for the fun of it.

Despite the name, the series covers Operating System flavors or, as the Linux community likes to call them, Distributions.

Each episode looks at a different operating system and quickly looks at the basics of an OS from the perspective of an average user. Episodes are meant to be informative and entertaining!

A regular episode usually has 6ish parts:

- Install
- Desktop & Default Apps
- Device + Media *tests*
- Network & Connectivity *tests*
- Gaming (legacy)
- Summary

The “script” for writing episodes is flexible because every OS & Distro is different. Which means each Distro Delves episode is a bit different. The script & tests are largely based on these checklists.

The series is open and is planned in Github, the video is captured on real hardware, and everything is produced with Linux & Open Source Software.

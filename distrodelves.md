_The best damn Operating System & Linux Distro overview show on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J)!_

Despite the name, the show covers *all* Operating Systems. Or, as the Linux community likes to call them, **Distributions**!

### What's the point?
Because operating systems are fun! *(no, seriously)*

Each episode looks at an operating system and quickly examines the it from an average user's perspective.

A live episode usually has these segments:

- Install
- Resource Usage
- Desktop & Apps
- Network & Sharing
- External Devices
- Media Playback
- Destruction/Bricking

Episodes are meant to be informative *and* entertaining!

Each episode is streamed on physical hardware when possible. Some operating systems require special or outdated hardware and for those, virtualization (QEMU, Dosbox, etc) is used.

### Production Software
All episodes are produced with Linux & Open Software! The only exception is my [HD60](https://amzn.to/335LjSs), which only has driver support for macOS & Windows.

Episode scripts are written in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and checked with [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

Voice-over audio is recorded and edited using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). I use Noise-Gate and Compressor plugins. My microphone is a [SM57](https://amzn.to/3m4x4Gq).

Episodes are produced and rendered using [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) [18.12](https://files.kde.org/kdenlive/release/), the last truly stable version of Kdenlive.

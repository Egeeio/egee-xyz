        I'm a software engineer by trade, mostly Web Development, with a particular focus in DevOps, SQA, and Release Management.
        I'm well versed working remote and I have lots of experience working with teams and people from all over the world.

        My spoken language is English, but I'm programming language agnostic. My comfort languages are <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, <i>Python</i>,
        and <i>C#</i>, but I can quickly learn and use whatever.

## About this Website

The purpose of this website is to have one place where people can learn about Egee and find out more about all of the things that I do.

I've used sites like Blogger, [Medium](https://medium.com/@egee_irl), and even self-hosted blogs like Ghost but none of them worked the way that I needed them to. Link aggregator websites are pretty simple and hosting developer documentation is cake, so why not just write my own?

This website is actually built from two different frameworks, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and designed to look and feel like a single website:

The front/landing page is a very basic Jekyll website built with [bulma.io](https://bulma.io) styled to look like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) or [Campsite](https://campsite.bio/).

The Egee Docs (this website) is a mkdocs website using a theme forked from the [Ivory theme](https://github.com/daizutabi/mkdocs-ivory) and styled to better match the landing page.

The source for both websites is [Open](https://github.com/egee-irl/egee-xyz) and lives in a single git repo on Github. The website runs in AWS and is automagically deployed by an automated CI/CD process.

## Who is Brian

Hiya, I'm Brian. I am Egee's creator and owner. Egee started out as a mascot for my YouTube channel way back in the day but since then, I've made "playing" Egee a hobby and now I'm basically a fully fledged furry!

I'm a Software Engineer in real life and I focus on DevOps/SRE, SQA, and document writing.

Audio and voice work has become another hobby of mine and I've recorded some professional

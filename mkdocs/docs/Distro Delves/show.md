_The original Operating System Radio Show on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J)!_

Despite the name, the show covers _all_ Operating Systems. Or, as the Linux community likes to call them, **Distributions**!

Episodes are meant to be informative _and_ entertaining!

### Is this really a thing?

Yes! Operating Systems are fun! _(no, seriously)_

Each show looks at an operating system and quickly examines the it from an average user's perspective.

A regular episode usually has these segments:

- Install
- Resource Usage
- Desktop & Apps
- Network & Sharing
- External Devices
- Media Playback
- Destruction/Bricking

Each episode is streamed on physical hardware when possible. Some operating systems require special or outdated hardware and for those, virtualization (QEMU, Dosbox, etc) is used.

### Why is the music so loud?

A huge part of the Distro Delves Show **is** the background music!

I usually try to pick background music that fits with the operating system under test. For example, an episode looking at Windows 95 would have songs from the 90s as background music.

I like listening to music so why not play some good tunes while reviewing an operating system?

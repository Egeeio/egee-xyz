## Egee

![]({{ 'public/egeeby_@SunsetCollie.jpeg' | relative_url }})

Egee is my fursona! His original appearance was based on my White Husky named Ghost. He has incorporated other colors and now he's basically a dilute Red Husky.

He was the very first mascot for the YouTube channel before I even knew what the furry fandom was.

His outfit usually consists of a red hoodie, black tank-top, and dark jeans. He occasionally wears shorts instead of pants, usually sans hoodie. His hair is brown and shaggy between his ears and neck.

Egee is very festive and loves holidays & color. His favorite alt hairstyle is half-dye with the Bi Pride Flag.

Since Egee is basically me in furry form, our personalities are practically the same!

I'm Brian! But you may know me as Egee, the character I created for my YouTube channel.

I host the Distro Delves show on YouTube, live stream on Twitch, run Egee.io, and hack on lots of Open Source Software projects!

This is my personal home pageâ„¢ and virtual portfolio of sorts.


### Whois

Egee is my fursona; he started as a mascot for the YouTube channel but evolved into a fursona and character in his own right.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer with a focus in mostly in DevOps, SQA, and Release Management based out of the Pacific Northwest ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

I work remotely and have lots of experience working with teams and people from all over the world.

My spoken language is English, but I am programming language agnostic. My favorite languages <i>Python</i>, <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, 
and <i>C#</i>.

I'm Brian! But you may know me as [Egee]({{ site.baseurl }}/ocs), the character I created for YouTube.

I host the [Distro Delves]({{ site.baseurl }}/distrodelves) show on YouTube, live stream on Twitch, run Egee.io, and hack on many Open Source Software projects.

This is my Personal Home Page â„¢ and virtual portfolio of sorts.


### Who is Egee?

Egee is my fursona; he started as a mascot for the YouTube channel but evolved into a character in his own right!

I'm a Linux user & software engineer with a focus in in DevOps, SQA, and Release Management. I currently reside in the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).

I work remotely and have lots of experience working with teams and people from all over the world.

My spoken language is English, but I am programming language agnostic. My favorite languages are <i>Python</i>, <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, 
and <i>C#</i>.

When I'm not coding or producing Distro Delves episodes, I'm either playing games on Twitch, chatting on Discord, writing music, or hanging out with my family.

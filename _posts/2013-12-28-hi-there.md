I'm Brian. But you may know me as [Egee]({{ site.baseurl }}/ocs): the character I made for YouTube!

I host the Distro Delves show, live stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/egeexyz), run Egee.io, and hack on many Open Source Software projects.

This is my Personal Home Page â„¢ and link aggregator of sorts.


### Who is Egee?

Egee is my fursona! He started as a mascot for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Egeeirl) but evolved into a character in his own right.

I'm a Linux user & software engineer with a focus on DevOps and SQA. I currently reside in the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).

I work remotely and have lots of experience working with teams and people from all over the world.

My spoken language is English but I am programming language agnostic. My [favorite languages](https://coderstats.net/github/#egee-irl) are <i>Python</i>, <i>TypeScript</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, 
and <i>C#</i>.

If you want to chat with me, I'm always on [Discord]([Egee]({{ site.baseurl }}/discord) but I generally avoid DMs so feel free to (at) me.

I'm also active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/egee_irl), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@egeeirl), and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/egeeirl).

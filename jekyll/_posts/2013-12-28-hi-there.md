I'm Brian. But you probably know me as _Egee_ from YouTube!

I host the [Distro Delves Show](/distrodelves) and produce content for a few other channels.

This is my Personal Home Page â„¢ and link aggregator of sorts.

### Who is Egee?

Egee is an anthropomorphic Red Husky! He started out as a mascot & character for my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Egeeirl) channel but now he's just _me_.

I'm a software engineer with a focus on DevOps and SQA. I currently reside in the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).

My spoken language is English but I am programming language agnostic. My favorite languages are Python, CoffeeScript, Ruby, and Bash.

I also live stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/egeexyz), run & moderate [Egee.io](https://egee.io), and hack on lots of Open Source Software projects.

If you want to get in touch with me, I'm always on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/egee_irl), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/egeeirl), and [Discord](https://egee.io).

Hiya!

I'm Brian. But you probably know me as Egee from YouTube!

I host the <a href="/distrodelves">Distro Delves Show</a> and produce content for a few other channels.

This is my Personal Home Page â„¢ and link aggregator of sorts.

Who is Egee?

Egee is an anthropomorphic Red Husky! He started out as a mascot & character for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Egeeirl">YouTube channel</a> but now he's just me.

I'm a software engineer with a focus on DevOps and SQA. I currently reside in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>.

My spoken language is English but I am programming language agnostic. My favorite languages are Python, CoffeeScript, Ruby, and Bash.

I also live stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/egeexyz">Twitch</a>, run & moderate <a href="https://egee.io">Egee.io</a>, and hack on lots of Open Source Software projects.

If you want to get in touch with me, I'm always on <a href="https://twitter.com/egee_irl">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://egee.io">Discord</a>.

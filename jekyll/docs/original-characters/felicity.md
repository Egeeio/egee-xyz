## Felicity

Felicity is a [fossa](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)>) inspired by Ubuntu's Focal Fossa.

Each Ubuntu version is named after a (usually obscure) animal, and fossae are neat but mostly unknown mongoose-like critters. I thought it would be fun to make an anthropomorphic one!

She is a software developer that loves and prefers Open Source Software but is open-minded and will work with proprietary software if needed.

I often use Felicity as a character to try out different poses and scenes with Egee!

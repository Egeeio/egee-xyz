## Laiokan

Laiokan is the more "adult" of my OC's. I don't have a commission of him yet.

He is _probably_ the first real character I ever made when I was a kid and really into RPG games. He's is a lizard (usually an Iguana) with questionable morality.

I make a version of him in nearly every RPG I play and he usually has the same personality: sinister with just enough morality to keep him from being a villain.

His scales are natually green but he has gray and white scales because he may or may not be a vampire.

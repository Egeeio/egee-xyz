OC means _Original Character_. It's a bit like a character in a story!

Egee is my main character but I've made several others. I have ideas to include them in a [game](https://github.com/egee-irl/the-game) at some point.

Here are some of the OC's I have created:

## Egee

Egee is my fursona! His original appearance was based on my White Husky named Ghost. He has incorporated other colors and now he's basically a dilute Red Husky.

He was the very first mascot for the YouTube channel before I even knew what the furry fandom was.

His outfit usually consists of a red hoodie, black tank-top, and dark jeans. He occasionally wears shorts instead pants, usually sans hoodie. His his is brown and shaggy between his ears and neck.

Egee is very festive and loves holidays & color. His favorite alt hairstyle is half-dye with the Bi Pride Flag.

Since Egee is basically me in furry form, our personalities are practically the same!

## Laiokan

Laiokan the more "adult" of my OC's and I don't have commission of him yet.

He is _probably_ the first _real_ character I ever made when I was a kid and really into RPG games. He's is a lizard (usually an Iguana) with questionable morality.

I make a version of him in nearly every RPG I play and he usually has the same personality: sinister with just enough morality to keep him from being a villain.

His scales are natually green but he has gray and white scales because he may or may not be a vampire.

## Androgee

Androgee is a protogen and a foil to Egee. I don't have a commission of him yet either. ðŸ˜“

The name Androgee comes from _Android_ and _Egee_ because I wanted a super clever name for my [Discord bot](https://github.com/egee-irl/androgee-legacy).

The API key got leaked and Androgee griefed the Discord server. After that, I got the idea that Androgee would be an antagonist to Egee.

Androgee is a relatively basic protogen that resembles Egee. He is seemingly under the control of Egee. For now.

## Felicity

Felicity is a [fossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)) inspired by Ubuntu's Focal Fossa.

Each Ubuntu version is named after a (usually obscure) animal, and fossae are neat but mostly unknown mongoose-like critters. I thought it would be fun to make an anthropomorphic one!

She is a software developer that loves and prefers Open Source Software but is open-minded and will work with proprietary software if needed.

I often use Felicity as a character to try out different poses and scenes with Egee!

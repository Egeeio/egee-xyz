OC stands for "Original Character - kind of like a character you create in an RPG game!

Some people create characters and fursonas with backstories and personalities. Some have artwork and stories, and others have full fursuits!

Here are some of the OC's I have created:

### Egee

Egee's original appearance was based on my White Husky named Ghost. Eventually, he incorporated other colors, and now he's basically a Red Husky.

He was the very first mascot for the YouTube channel before I even knew what the furry fandom was!

Since Egee is basically me in furry form, our personalities are practically the same. However, Egee is probably sassier than me.

## Felicity

Felicity is a [fossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)) inspired by Ubuntu's Focal Fossa.

Each Ubuntu version is named after a (usually obscure) animal, and fossae are neat but mostly unknown mongoose-like critters. I thought it would be fun to make an anthropomorphic one!

Felicity is a software developer that loves and prefers Open Source Software but is open-minded and will work with proprietary software if needed.

# My Games

Out of all the different types of software I've worked on, game development is the most enjoyable. I never want to code games professionally but i have written a few indie games for fun.

### Jumper

I wrote a super basic platformer game called [Jumper](https://github.com/egee-irl/jumper) for a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88DS3Z8nOdY) I produced on YouTube. The video got pretty popular so I polished it up and made a playable demo out of it.

It's basically a clone of the original PhaserJS 2 tutorial with slightly different art assets and coding style. PhaserJS 2 is deprecated and I have no plans to update the game.

You can play a demo of it [here](https://jumper.egee.xyz).

### The Unnamed Egee Game

I always wanted to write a clone of a nostalgic NES game with a free & open source engine or toolkit. I learned about Godot and decided to try and recreate the Amazon stage from DuckTales. While I was working on the clone I asked "what if it was Egee instead of Scrooge McDuck?".

I created Egee and all the blocks with Aesprite and put together a prototype. It's not in a playable state but you can checkout the code and build it (if you are crafty) [here](https://github.com/egee-irl/the-game).

Note that the code & most of the art assets are free to use but the Egee sprites are not.

### Vibbles

The very first playable game I ever wrote was a Nibbles clone called [Vibbles](https://github.com/egee-irl/vibbles). It is written in Vala, a free & open source language written for the GTK toolkit. It uses raw GTK and Cairo to render the screen and handle input controls.

There's nothing particularly special about this game besides it being the first game I ever wrote. It was a chore to write and the only thing I really "learned" from it was how to handle input controls. I would not recommend trying to write a game without a game framework or toolkit unless it is something you enjoy doing.

# Original Characters

Here are some of the OC's I have created. Feel free to make fanart of them if you want!

## Egee

Egee started out as just an idea for a mascot for my YouTube channel. He was intended to be a [Konqi](https://community.kde.org/Konqi) but I decided to make him a Red Husky instead because I wanted something original to the community I was producing content for.

His initial design was a simple anthropomorphic Red Husky with cyan colored eyes. Besides being more floofy and having more outfits, his overall design is practically the same as the very [first](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/29900485/) commission I got of him.

He slender but floofy with white on his front and red/gold on his back, ears, and nose. His hair is brown and shaggy and he's is normally 180cm tall but in the alternate universe he's only about 30cm tall.

## Androgee

Androgee was the name I gave the first [Discord bot](https://github.com/egee-irl/androgee-legacy) I wrote for my Discord server. "Androgee" is basically an _android_ version of _Egee_.

They didn't develop a character until much later when I thought it would be fun to have a story or game of Egee that includes a cliche robot companion, akin to [Rush](<https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Rush#:~:text=Rush%20(%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%2C%20Rasshu)%20is,Mega%20Man%20in%20his%20travels.>) for Megaman.

Androgee is a chonky cyan & aquamarine Protogen with siamese cat color patterns but with lots of extra floof and a big giant multi-purpose tail. He stands at about 200cm.

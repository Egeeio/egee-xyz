# Original Characters

Here are some of the OC's I have created:

## Egee

Egee started out as just an idea for a mascot for my YouTube channel. He was originally going to be a [Konqi](https://community.kde.org/Konqi) but I decided to make him a Red Husky instead because I wanted something original to the community I was producing content for.

His original design was a simple anthromorphic Red Husky with cyan colored eyes. Besides being more floofy and having more outfits, his overall design is practically the same as the very [first](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/29900485/) commission I got of him.

He slender but floofy with white on his front and red/gold on his back, ears, eyes, and nose. He is 180cm tall and in the alternate universe he's about 30cm tall. His hair is brown and shaggy between his ears and neck.

You are more than welcome to make fanart of him but please be respectful!

## Androgee

Androgee was the name I gave the first [Discord bot](https://github.com/egee-irl/androgee-legacy) I wrote for my Discord server. "Androgee" is an agglomeration of "Android" and Egee.

They didn't develop a character until much later when I decided it would be cool for a story about Egee that includes a cliche robot companion, akin to [Rush](<https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Rush#:~:text=Rush%20(%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%2C%20Rasshu)%20is,Mega%20Man%20in%20his%20travels.>) for Megaman.

Androgee is a chonky cyan & aquamarine Protogen with siamese cat color patterns with lots of extra floof and a big giant multi-purpose tail. He stands at about 200cm.

# Support Me!

There are a couple different ways you can support my work:

### Ko-fi

Ko-fi _(pronounced like coffee)_ is slick donation platform that offers 0% platform fees. Its' focus is single one-time donations but it also supports memberships, commissions, and a storefont for products. It also has a Google+-esque social media aspect with a storyline, high-res photo gallery, and etc.

Ko-fi is the preferred place for one-off tips and donations because it is integrated to existing payment networks and has 0% platform/transaction fees. Feel free to subscribe here if you want, too!

### Patreon

Patreon is a subscription-focused support platform that is based around "Patrons" which are basically subscribers that opt into a rewards tier.

I blog (written & audio) here and share IRL stuff here but I don't currently offer much in the way of goals or rewards besides the good feeling of supporting a content creator!

# Hiya!

I'm Egee - Welcome to my website! I do work on a plethora of stuff and this website helps organize all of my links and projects. It's is my Personal Home Pageâ„¢ and link aggregator of sorts.

I host the [Distro Delves Show](/distrodelves) on one YouTube channel, produce [asmr](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjaqCM6u1i78VNsoL_jW5lg) content for another channel, live stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/egeexyz), contribute to Open Source on [Github](https://github.com/egee-irl), and produce music on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/egeeirl).

### Who is Egee/Brian?

Egee _(pronounced 'E-jee')_ is an anthromorphic Red Husky. If you'd like to learn about Egee, the _original character_, go [here](/ocs).

He started out as a mascot for my main YouTube channel at the time. He became the "character" I played for the channel but he eventually become more like me (or me like him!) and now I'm basically just Egee all the time.

In real life, I am a multi-hat software engineer with proficiencies in SQA, SRE, DevOps, and technical writing. I wrote this website from scratch so I guess I wear a web-dev hat too.

I am agnostic about programming language but I prefer interpreted languages such as Python, Ruby, and Bash.

I also do voice-work from time to time and currently reside in the beautiful [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).

### Contact

If you want to get in touch with me, you are welcome to DM me. I am most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/egee_irl) and I announce it there if I'm planning to be or go somewhere like a convention or event.

I'm also on Discord! You can find me in the [Egee.io](https://egee.io) community Discord server. Be sure to follow the community rules if you join.

Please keep in mind that I am usually very busy during the week and I have a policy of not responding to one-word DM's (hi, hey, hello, uwu, etc).

If you want to contact me about a community or professional engagement, feel free to email me: brian(a)egee.io.

### About this Website

The purpose of this website is to have one place where people can learn about Egee and find out more about all of the things that I do.

I've used sites like [Medium](https://medium.com/@egee_irl) and Ghost.io but none of them worked the way that I needed them to so I decided to write my own.

This website is just a simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) app with a theme based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and customized with [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/).

The code is Open Source and lives in [Github](https://github.com/egee-irl/egee-xyz). The website runs in AWS and is automagically deployed by an automated CI/CD process.

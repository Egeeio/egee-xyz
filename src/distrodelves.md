# Distro Delves Show

_The original Operating System review show!_

Despite the name, the show covers _all_ types of consumer-oriented Operating Systems and not just BSD or Linux distributions.

Some of the information on this page was lifted from the original [Medium publication](https://medium.com/distro-delves) when I started Distro Delves. The show has changed a lot since then and you can read about the beginnings of the show over there.

### Premise

Distro Delves started out as a [web series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J) on YouTube that seeks to review desktop operating systems in an interesting and entertaining format.

Each episode looks at a particular operating system from the perspective of an average or _target_ user. Starting with Season 3, each operating system is rated according to it's "Jank Factor" and ranked at the end of the season.

The season finale gives "Delvie Awards" to the best, worst, and most janky of all the operating systems tested throughout the season.

Episodes are live streamed on YouTube every **Sunday** at **9am PST**.

Most regular episodes usually consist these segments:

- Install/Step Process
- Baseline System Resource Usage
- Desktop Layout & Overview
- Pre-Installed Apps
- Network & Sharing
- Media Playback
- Gaming Performance
- Destruction/Bricking

There's also a [Github](https://github.com/egee-irl/distro-delves) repository with an extended checklist as well as helper scripts that I've used throughout the series.

Most episodes are produced on physical hardware (usually mini-pc's). Virtualization and emulation is used for some operating systems that require special or outdated hardware.

If you'd like to help out with the show and assist me in aquiring new hardware, you are more than welcome to donate on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/egee) or subscribe to me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/egeeirl).

### What is up with the music?

A big part of the Distro Delves Show is the background music. It's typically much louder than other live shows and that is (usually) on purpose.

The tradition of loud & copyrighted music began when I started live streaming Distro Delves and I wanted to see how far I could push YouTube's Content ID system.

I do not monetize my live streams so that I can "get away" with playing copyrighted music and not have to worry about revenue sharing or other issues that come from playing music on YouTube.

Most of the music played on the show is "background-friendly" music such as from Future Funk, Outrun, and Vaporwave genres:

- [Side~A](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/02OnhOLvpV05A7Xrjv6lCV?si=b4ac433ca6e8447b): Future Funk w/Jazzhop mixed in
- [Side~B](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1zDxKuQUfaBj450oKUvbT8?si=13852c04c7b248cd) - Vaporwave & Chillwave
- [Side~C](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Yt88VjxhFPOcZ9kk3FvAM?si=ca05c3baf66d4177) - Outrun & other fast head-bobbing tunes

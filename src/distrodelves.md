# Distro Delves Show

_The original Operating System Review Show!_

Despite the name, the show covers _all_ types of consumer-oriented Operating Systems and not just BSD or Linux distributions.

Some of the information on this page was lifted from the original [Medium publication](https://medium.com/distro-delves) when I started Distro Delves. The show has changed a lot since then and you can read about the beginnings of the show over there.

### Premise

Distro Delves started as a web series on YouTube and seeks to review old & new operating systems in an entertaining and informational format.

Each episode looks at a particular operating system, sometimes with developers & maintainers from the community, from the perspective of an average or "target" user, examines it, and ranks it a "Jank Factor".

At the end of the year there is a special episode where Delvie awards are handed out to the best and worst operating systems seen that year.

They are streamed on YouTube every Sunday at 9am PST.

Most regular episodes usually consist these segments:

- Installer
- System Resource Usage
- Desktop Layout & Overview
- Pre-Installed Apps
- Network & Sharing
- External Devices
- Media Playback
- Destruction/Bricking

Most episodes are produced on physical hardware (usually mini-pc's). Virtualization and emulation is used for some operating systems that require special or outdated hardware. If you'd like to help out with the show and assist me in aquiring new hardware, you are more than welcome to donate on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/egee) or subscribe to me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/egeeirl).

### Why is the music so loud?

A huge part of the Distro Delves Show **is** the background music!

I usually try to pick background music that fits with the operating system under test. For example, an episode looking at Windows 95 would have songs from the 90s as background music.

I like listening to music so why not play some good tunes while reviewing an operating system?
